Tzdb.resx
  The current version of TZDB compiled using the current version of
  TzdbCompiler with the ResX output format. A test verifies that this is

Tzdb2012iFromNodaTime1.0.resx
  TZDB 2012i, as distributed with Noda Time 1.0 (in ResX format, which was
  all that version of Noda Time supported). A test verifies that we can
  read and use the file's contents using the current version of the resource
  parser.

Tzdb2013bFromNodaTime1.1.nzd
  TZDB 2013b, as distributed with Noda Time 1.1 (in NodaZoneData format).
