    <h1>Installation</h1>
    <p>Our primary distribution channel is <a href="http://nuget.org">NuGet</a> with
two packages:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/NodaTime">NodaTime</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/NodaTime.Testing">NodaTime.Testing</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, source and binary downloads are available on the
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/noda-time/downloads/list">project download page</a>.</p>

<p>An experimental assembly to support Json.NET is also available (in source form
only); see the <a href="serialization.html">serialization guide</a> for more information.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../developer/building.html">"Building and testing"</a> section in the developer guide for
instructions on building Noda Time from source.</p>

<h2>System requirements</h2>

<p>As of release 1.1, there are two builds of Noda Time: the desktop version and the Portable Class Library version.</p>

<p>The desktop version requires .NET 3.5 (client profile). This build also supports Mono, <a href="mono.html">with some caveats</a>.</p>

<p>The PCL build is configured to support:</p>

<ul>
<li>.NET Framework 4 and higher</li>
<li>Silverlight 4 and higher</li>
<li>Windows Phone 7 and higher</li>
<li>.NET for Windows Store apps</li>
</ul>

<p>Noda Time does <em>not</em> support XBox 360 or Silverlight 3, and it's unlikely that we'd ever want to introduce support
for these. (It's more likely that over time, we'll drop support for Silverlight - but not imminently, of course.)
See the <a href="limitations.html">limitations</a> page for differences between the PCL build and the desktop build.</p>

<h2>Package contents and getting started</h2>

<p>Everything you need to <em>use</em> Noda Time is contained in the NodaTime package. The NodaTime.Testing package is designed
for testing code which uses Noda Time. See the <a href="testing.html">testing guide</a> for more information. It is expected
that production code will only refer to the <code>NodaTime.dll</code> assembly, and that's all that's required at execution time.
This assembly includes the <a href="tzdb.html">TZDB database</a> as an embedded resource.</p>

<p>Everything within the NodaTime assembly is in the NodaTime namespace or a "child" namespace. After adding a reference to
the main assembly (either directly via the file system or with NuGet) and including an appropriate <code>using</code> directive, you should
be able to start using Noda Time immediately, with no further effort.</p>
