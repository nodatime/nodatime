    <h1>Coding Conventions</h1>
    <h2>Use of C# and .NET features</h2>

<p>Noda Time targets .NET 3.5, and the code only uses features available in C# 3. While we normally build against a C# 4 or C# 5 compiler, most later features aren't useful:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dynamic typing requires .NET 4</li>
<li>Generic variance relies on the appropriate attributes being applied to the types in question, and the most useful types (e.g. <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> don't have those attributes in .NET 3.5)</li>
<li>Async methods require .NET 4.5, or .NET 4 with the async targeting pack</li>
<li>The iteration variable capture rules for <code>foreach</code> would require <em>all</em> developers to use C# 5 compilers. <strong>Please</strong> do not rely on this.</li>
<li>Optional parameters wouldn't be useful to C# 3 users, so our API design assumes they're <em>not</em> available</li>
<li>Caller member info attributes require .NET 4.5.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, we're trying not to use framework features we don't need to gratuitously, in case we ever want to backport to .NET 2.0. That's unlikely given that it would mean
dropping <code>TimeZoneInfo</code> support, but it's always a possibility. Additionally, we're very likely to want to create a Portable Class Library at some point, so where possible, stick
to core features which won't make this harder than it needs to be. (Don't worry too much though - don't feel you need to look up every member.)</p>

<h2>Code Layout</h2>

<ul>
<li>Use the Visual Studio <em>default</em> settings in Tools | Options | Text Editor |
C# | Formatting.</li>
<li>Use spaces not tabs
(<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/noda-time/msg/54e7262a08d1ce38">discussion</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2>File Layout</h2>

<ul>
<li>Place using statements at the top of the file (not in the namespace).</li>
<li>A single namespace in any one file.</li>
<li><em>Prefer</em> a single type in a file.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>using System;

namespace ConsoleApplication1
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            if (args.Length &gt; 1)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Hello " + args[0]);
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Hello world!");
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Working With Multiple C# Formatting Configurations</h2>

<p>Using Tools | Import and Export Settings the C# formatting settings can be selectively saved and then reloading. All the C# formatting options fall under All Options | Options | Text Editor | C# Editor. (The "C#" option holds the non-formatting settings.)</p>

<h2>Naming of tests</h2>

<p>Follow a <code>Method_State_Result</code> pattern:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Method</code> is the name of the method being tested, possibly with some more information for overload disambiguation</li>
<li><code>State</code> describes the scenario that is being tested</li>
<li><code>Result</code> describes what is the expected behavior</li>
</ul>

<p>When any of the last two is really redundant, it can be omitted, like when the
<code>State</code> would be <code>ValidValues</code> or similar, or the <code>Result</code> would be <code>ItWorks</code>.</p>
