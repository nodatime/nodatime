    <h1>Time zone database file format</h1>
    <p>This document describes the Noda Time-specific binary file format that
<code>ZoneInfoCompiler</code> produces. <code>ZoneInfoCompiler</code> reads the text files from
<a href="http://www.iana.org/time-zones">tzdb</a> (aka zoneinfo) and some additional
input from CLDR; it produces one of two different output formats:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>a .NET resource file containing a number of different resources
  (including, for example, one for each time zone), serialised as either
  an XML (<code>.resx</code>) or compiled (<code>.resources</code>) file. This is the only
  format accepted by Noda Time 1.0.x.</p></li>
<li><p>a binary file format (the "NodaZoneData" format) that does not depend
  upon a .NET resource file acting as a container. This is the default
  format in Noda Time 1.1 and later, and is the only format supported by
  the Portable Class Library versions of Noda Time.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The formats have some similarities, but can be treated independently. In
particular, the resource format supported by Noda Time 1.0.x is effectively
frozen, while the NodaZoneData format will evolve as more data is required.</p>

<h1>Version compatibility</h1>

<p>Most users will just use the version of the database embedded in the Noda
Time assembly (which is typically produced with the same version of
<code>ZoneInfoCompiler</code> as the Noda Time assembly itself), and so do not need to
worry about these details, but as we provide the ability to use a custom
compiled time zone database, we document here the compatibility rules
between the output produced by different versions of <code>ZoneInfoCompiler</code> and
the Noda Time assembly.</p>

<p>In general, these are probably as you would expect: any version of Noda Time
must be able to read a compiled time zone database consumed by an earlier
version of Noda Time with the same major version number; the reverse,
however, is not true.</p>

<p>For example, Noda Time 1.1.x should be able to read the compiled output used
by Noda Time 1.0.x and 1.1.x, but would not necessarily be able to read the
output used by version 1.2.x. Noda Time 2.x does not necessarily need to be
able to read anything consumed by Noda Time 1.x.</p>

<p>(The same is true for the PCL version of Noda Time, though it is considered
a separate development line for the purposes of compatibility, and so does
not need to support the same features as the earlier [non-PCL] versions.)</p>

<p>Note that even though Noda Time must <em>read</em> earlier versions of the compiled
database, it does not necessarily need to provide the same level of
functionality when doing so as it might when reading a current version. In
particular, only calls to methods supported by that earlier version of Noda
Time are guaranteed to work; any calls to methods introduced in a later
version may require a database compiled by at least that version.</p>

<p>The former is true because semantic versioning requires that we be able to
drop a later version of the Noda Time assembly into a running environment
without recompiling (or without replacing the compiled time zone database,
which might e.g. be embedded in the main executable); the latter statement
is true because it is unreasonable to expect that new functionality should
work without the new data it may require.</p>

<p>As a consequence, it is reasonable to act as if any functionality introduced
in a given version of Noda Time comes with an implicit caveat that it
requires a database compiled against at least that version to work.</p>

<h1>NodaZoneData format</h1>

<p>Compiling the input data using the (default) <code>NodaZoneData</code> option produces
a compiled database in the "NodaZoneData" format.</p>

<p>TODO</p>

<h1>Resource file format</h1>

<p>Compiling the input data using the <code>Resource</code> or <code>ResX</code> option produces a
compiled database in the resource file format native to Noda Time 1.0.x.
This is represented as a .NET resource file containing many resources: one
resource for each time zone, and four additional meta-information resources.</p>

<p>The four meta-information resources, and their resource keys, are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>--meta-VersionId</code>, a <code>String</code> resource containing the tzdb version ID
 (e.g. "2012i")</li>
<li><code>--meta-IdMap</code>, a <code>byte[]</code> resource containing a serialised
 <code>dictionary</code> (see below for the definition of these types), mapping all
 known time zone IDs (aliases and non-aliases) to a non-alias time zone
 ID</li>
<li><code>--meta-WindowsToPosix</code>, a <code>byte[]</code> resource containing a serialised
 <code>dictionary</code>, mapping Windows time zone names to the corresponding tzdb
 time zone ID</li>
<li><code>--meta-WindowsToPosixVersion</code>, a <code>String</code> resource containing the
 revision number of the Windows mapping data (e.g. "7825")</li>
</ul>

<p>Each non-alias time zone is represented by a <code>byte[]</code> resource containing a
serialised <code>timezone</code>. The name of the resource is derived from the time zone
ID, with (theoretically) some substitutions for invalid characters.  (The
substitutions are not documented here, since they do not actually appear to be
used in practice; for example, the name of the Europe/London resource is simply
"Europe/London", and the same appears to be true for all other time zones as of
the 2012i tzdb). </p>

<p>All of these resources may (theoretically) contain extra appended data not
mentioned below; readers do not confirm that the end of the resource was
reached when all the data they know how to read has been consumed.</p>

<h2>Serialisation primitives</h2>

<p>The resource file format uses the following serialisation primitives:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>byte</code>, a general 8-bit unsigned integer</li>
<li><code>fixed16</code>, <code>fixed32</code>, and <code>fixed64</code>, general 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit
 signed integers</li>
<li><code>count</code>, a non-negative (typically small) <code>int32</code> value</li>
<li><code>offset</code>, an <code>int32</code> value representing a millisecond offset from UTC</li>
<li><code>string</code>, a UTF-8 encoded text string</li>
<li><code>dictionary</code>, a dictionary with string keys and values</li>
<li><code>timezone</code>, a serialised time zone (with several variants and subtypes,
 documented below)</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these, only <code>dictionary</code> and <code>timezone</code> are used directly; the others are
used as part of the definitions of these types, below.</p>

<h3>byte</h3>

<p>A <code>byte</code> is simply serialised as a single byte representing a value in the
range 0..255.</p>

<h3>fixed16, fixed32, fixed64</h3>

<p><code>fixed16</code>, <code>fixed32</code>, and <code>fixed64</code> are simply serialised as 2-, 4-, or
8-byte twos-complement values of the appropriate length, in MSB-first order.
For example, <code>0x1234</code> would be serialised as the bytes <code>[0x12 0x34]</code> using
the <code>fixed16</code> serialisation, while -1 would be serialised as <code>[0xff 0xff]</code>.</p>

<h3>count</h3>

<p>A <code>count</code> encodes a non-negative (typically small) <code>int32</code> value; it is
serialised as a variable number of bytes according to the following
scheme:</p>

<ul>
<li>values <code>0x00</code>..<code>0x8e</code> are serialised as a single byte; values to <code>0x0e</code>
 are serialised as <code>0xf0</code>..<code>0xfe</code>, while <code>0x0f</code>..<code>0x8e</code> is serialised as
 <code>0x00</code>..<code>0x7f</code></li>
<li><code>0x8f</code>..<code>0x408e</code> is serialised as two bytes, by subtracting <code>0x8f</code> and
 then encoding the resulting (<code>0</code>&ndash;<code>0x3fff</code>) value using the byte
 <code>0x80</code>..<code>0xbf</code> for the MSB, followed by the LSB</li>
<li><code>0x408f</code>..<code>0x20408e</code> is serialised as three bytes, by subtracting
 <code>0x408f</code> and then encoding the resulting (<code>0</code>&ndash;<code>0x1fffff</code>) value
 as the byte <code>0xc0</code>..<code>0xdf</code> for the MSB, followed by the next two bytes
 in MSB-first order (i.e. as a <code>fixed16</code>)</li>
<li><code>0x20408f</code>..<code>0x1020408e</code> is serialised as four bytes, by subtracting
 <code>0x20408f</code> (giving <code>0</code>&ndash;<code>0x0fffffff</code>), adding <code>0xe0000000</code>,
 and then encoding the resulting (<code>0xe0000000</code>&ndash;<code>0xefffffff</code>) value
 as a <code>fixed32</code></li>
<li>larger values are serialised as five bytes, as the leader <code>0xff</code>
 followed by the value as a <code>fixed32</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>offset</h3>

<p>An <code>offset</code> encodes an <code>int32</code> value representing an offset in milliseconds
from UTC. While the encoding below can in theory represent any <code>int32</code>
value, the use in Noda Time is solely for values in the range (-24 hours,
+24 hours); commonly for 'round' numbers of minutes, etc.</p>

<p>An <code>offset</code> is serialised as a variable-length field as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>offsets that are a multiple of 30 minutes are serialised as the single
 byte <code>0x10</code>..<code>0x6e</code> counting the number of 30 minute periods, with a
 bias such that <code>0x10</code> represents an offset of -23:30, <code>0x11</code> represents
 -23:00, <code>0x3f</code> represents a zero offset, and <code>0x6e</code> represents the
 offset +23:30</li>
<li>offsets that are a whole number of seconds are serialised as three
 bytes, the first of which is in the range <code>0x82</code>..<code>0x85</code>, by adding
 <code>0x83ffff</code> to the number of seconds, and writing three bytes in
 MSB-first order, so that <code>[0x82 0xae 0x80]</code> represents -23:59:59,
 <code>[0x84 0x00 0x00]</code> represents +00:00:01, and <code>[0x85 0x51 0x7e]</code>
 represents +23:59:59</li>
<li>any other offset is serialised as the leader <code>0xfd</code> followed by the number
 of milliseconds as a <code>fixed32</code></li>
</ul>

<p>(The serialisation method used additionally defines an encoding for
'out-of-range' offsets, but these cannot occur in practice, as the
underlying C# data type restricts the range of the offset to that described
above.)</p>

<h3>string</h3>

<p>A <code>string</code> is serialised as a <code>count</code> of the number of UTF-8 bytes in the
string followed by those bytes.</p>

<h3>dictionary</h3>

<p>A <code>dictionary</code> is serialised as a <code>count</code> number of entries in the
dictionary, followed by that number of pairs of <code>string</code> key and <code>string</code>
value.</p>

<h3>timezone</h3>

<p>A <code>timezone</code> encodes a time zone's contents sans ID, represented in one of a
few different forms depending on the type of the time zone. The serialised
format may be any of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>0x00</code> followed by another <code>timezone</code>, indicating that the following
 time zone (in practice, always one of type <code>0x04</code>) should have
 information about zone transitions cached at runtime if possible</li>
<li><code>0x01</code> followed by a <code>daylightsavingstimezone</code>, representing a time
 zone with a standard and DST offset, and simple recurrence rules for
 each transition</li>
<li><code>0x02</code> followed by an <code>offset</code>, representing a time zone with a fixed
 offset (and no DST); this is used natively when encoding time zones
 with no DST (such as "Etc/UTC") and as part of the composite
 "pre-calculated" time zone</li>
<li><code>0x03</code>, representing 'no time zone' (only used when encoding an absent
 tailzone for a pre-calculated zone)</li>
<li><code>0x04</code> followed by a <code>precalculatedtimezone</code>, representing a zone that
 expands all known transitions explicitly, up to an optional 'tail zone'
 representing a final (possibly DST-using) stable state</li>
</ul>

<h4>daylightsavingstimezone</h4>

<p>A <code>daylightsavingstimezone</code> is serialised as an <code>offset</code> containing the
standard offset followed by the DST <code>zonerecurrence</code> and the standard time
(non-DST) <code>zonerecurrence</code>.  The DST recurrence contains an offset that is
the additional delta from the standard offset for daylight savings time
(usually positive, but sometimes zero); the standard time recurrence is
guaranteed to have a zero offset.</p>

<h5>zonerecurrence</h5>

<p>A <code>zonerecurrence</code> is serialised as the <code>string</code> name of the recurrence
(e.g. "PST"), the <code>offset</code> containing the offset of this recurrence, a
description of when the recurrence occurs (the 'year offset'), followed by
two <code>count</code> values indicating the (inclusive) years the recurrence covers,
with a zero start year indicating a recurrence that starts at the beginning
of time.</p>

<p>(Note that 1.0 versions of NodaTime serialised the 'beginning of time' as
the year <code>int32.MinValue</code> instead of zero. The two should be treated
equally.)</p>

<p>The 'year offset' is:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <code>count</code> indicating whether transitions are relative to UTC (0), the
 'wall' (daylight savings) offset (1), or the standard offset (2)</li>
<li>a <code>count</code> of the month-of-year in which this recurrence starts, with a
 bias such that 13 represents January and 24 represents December</li>
<li>a <code>count</code> of the day-of-month in which this recurrence starts; values
 from 0..30 indicate a number of days [-31..-1] counted from the end of
 a (31 day) month (in practice, only 30 is used, to represent 'last
 [weekday] of the month'), while values from 32..62 represent the number
 of days [1..31] counted from the start of the month</li>
<li>a <code>count</code> of the day of week in which this recurrence start, with a
 bias such that 7 represents 'no day', and 8..13 represent
 Monday..Sunday</li>
<li>a <code>byte</code> indicating whether the day of month represents an upper bound
 (0) or lower bound (1); this is only relevant if a day of week is also
 specified, where the rule might be described as e.g. "first Tuesday on
 or after the 15th"</li>
<li>an <code>offset</code> representing the (non-negative) time of day that the
 recurrence starts</li>
<li>a <code>byte</code> indicating whether an additional day should be added to the
 calculation (1) or not (0), to cope with transitions documented as
 occurring at 24:00 - these may potentially spill into a following month</li>
</ul>

<h4>precalculatedtimezone</h4>

<p>A <code>precalculatedtimezone</code> is serialised as a string pool, a sequence of
<code>zoneinterval</code> periods representing an expansion of all known transitions,
and an optional 'tail zone' representing a final (possibly DST-using) stable
state.</p>

<p>Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>a per-time-zone string pool containing all the names of the intervals
 (e.g. "PST") used in this zone, as a <code>count</code> of the number of entries
 in the pool, followed by that number of <code>string</code> values</li>
<li>a <code>count</code> of the number of zoneinterval<code>periods, followed by that
 number of</code>zoneinterval` values</li>
<li>a <code>zoneintervaltransition</code> for the tail zone (as the end of time if
 there is no tail zone)</li>
<li>a <code>timezone</code> representing the tail zone, in practice always either of
 type <code>0x03</code> (no tail zone) or <code>0x01</code> (<code>daylightsavingstimezone</code>)</li>
</ul>

<h5>zoneinterval</h5>

<p>A <code>zoneinterval</code> is serialised as the <code>zoneintervaltransition</code> representing
the start of the transition (the beginning of time for the first one), an
index into the interval name string pool as either <code>byte</code> or <code>fixed32</code>
(based on the number of entries in the pool), an <code>offset</code> representing the
wall-time offset from UTC (including any daylight savings time) and a second
<code>offset</code> representing the daylight savings contribution (or zero if the
period is not a daylight savings period).</p>

<p>The periods serialised as part of a <code>precalculatedtimezone</code> cover the whole of
time, so each <code>zoneinterval</code> finishes at the start time of the next (or of
the tail zone).</p>

<h5>zoneintervaltransition</h5>

<p>A <code>zoneintervaltransition</code> represents an instant at which a transition
begins. It is serialised as a variable number of bytes according to the
following scheme, based on the (signed) number of ticks from the Unix epoch:</p>

<ul>
<li>the beginning of time and end of time as serialised as <code>0xfe</code> and
 <code>0xff</code> respectively</li>
<li>numbers of ticks that are a multiple of 30 minutes are serialised as
 the single byte <code>0x00</code>..<code>0x3e</code> counting the number of 30 minute
 periods, with a bias such that <code>0x00</code> represents -15:30, <code>0x01</code>
 represents -15:00, <code>0x1f</code> represents a zero offset, and <code>0x3e</code>
 represents the +15:30.</li>
</ul>

<p>TODO minutes and seconds:
   * offsets that are a whole number of seconds are serialised as three
     bytes, the first of which is in the range <code>0x82</code>..<code>0x85</code>, by adding
     <code>0x83ffff</code> to the number of seconds, and writing three bytes in
     MSB-first order, so that <code>[0x82 0xae 0x80]</code> represents -23:59:59,
     <code>[0x84 0x00 0x00]</code> represents +00:00:01, and <code>[0x85 0x51 0x7e]</code>
     represents +23:59:59.</p>

<ul>
<li>any other value is serialised as the leader <code>0xa0</code> followed by the
 number of ticks as a <code>fixed64</code></li>
</ul>
