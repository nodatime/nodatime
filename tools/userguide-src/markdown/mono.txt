Mono support

[Mono](http://mono-project.com) is an open source implementation of
the Common Language Infrastructure which runs on various platforms,
including Windows, Linux and OS X.

Noda Time runs on Mono, but with some limitations:

- Noda Time is not *developed* on Mono, so while releases will be tested
  against it (running all the unit tests), code which isn't part
  of a release may not work. Please raise an issue on the
  [tracker page](http://code.google.com/p/noda-time/issues/list) if
  you come across a breakage like this, and we'll fix it as soon
  as possible.
- `TimeZoneInfo` in Mono has some critical flaws in the latest stable
  Mono release at the time of this writing (2.10.8) - while
  [`BclDateTimeZone`](noda-type://NodaTime.TimeZones.BclDateTimeZone) *may*
  do the right thing, it may disagree with the results of calling
  methods directly on the time zone.
- Some cultures in Mono have standard date/time patterns including
  "z" for "offset from UTC". These will not display appropriately
  when used for text formatting in Noda Time, as the "z" is
  meaningless for local dates and times.
- Some cultures in Mono have standard date/time patterns which
  use the abbreviated am/pm designator, but have am/pm designators
  which are the same when abbreviated. In these cases, parsing
  is ambiguous.
- If you build Noda Time under Mono but execute it under the
  Microsoft .NET 4 64-bit CLR, you may see exceptions around
  type initializers and `RuntimeHelpers.InitializeArray`. We believe
  this to be due to a [bug in .NET](http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/635365)
  which the Mono compiler happens to trigger. We would recommend that
  you use a binary built by the Microsoft C# compiler if you wish
  to run using this CLR.

System requirements
-------------------

We have tested Mono support using Mono 2.10.5 and 2.10.8.

To build Noda Time under Linux, you typically need to install the following
packages:

- mono-devel
- mono-xbuild

(These will add the other dependencies you need.)

Note that for Ubuntu specifically, you'll either need Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric) or
later, or work out how to install an unofficial backport; earlier versions of
Ubuntu [do not include a suitable version of Mono][MonoUbuntu].

To build Noda Time under OS X, [download][MonoDownload] the latest stable
release of Mono. Be sure to choose the developer package, not the smaller
runtime-only package.  To use the provided `Makefile`, you'll either need to
install [Xcode][xcode] or obtain `make` separately (for example, using
[osx-gcc-installer][] to install just the open-source parts of Xcode).

[xcode]: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
[osx-gcc-installer]: https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer#readme

To fetch the source code from the main Google Code repository,
you'll need a Mercurial client.

To run the tests, you'll need
[NUnit](http://nunit.org/index.php?p=download) version 2.5.10 or
higher. (The version that comes with stable builds of Mono at the
time of this writing doesn't support everything used by the unit
tests of Noda Time.)

Fetching and building
---------------------

To fetch the source code, just clone the Google Code repository:

    $ hg clone https://code.google.com/p/noda-time/

Building is performed with `make`, using the included Makefile. (If you don't
have a working `make`, you can also run `xbuild` by hand; see `Makefile` for
the commands you'll need to run.)

    $ cd noda-time
    $ make

This will build all the Noda Time main projects. The main assembly will be
written to `src/NodaTime/bin/Debug/NodaTime.dll`; this is all you need to use
Noda Time itself.

Other build targets are also available; again, see `Makefile` for documentation.
In particular, to build and run the tests, run:

    $ make check

to use the default (probably Mono-supplied) version of NUnit to run the tests,
or something like the following to override the location of the NUnit test
runner:

    $ make check NUNIT='mono ../NUnit-2.6.0.12051/bin/nunit-console.exe'
