Unit testing with Noda Time

This page is not about how Noda Time itself is tested - it's about how you to test code
which *uses* Noda Time.

NodaTime.Testing
----------------

Firstly, get hold of the [NodaTime.Testing](http://nuget.org/packages/NodaTime.Testing) assembly. It's currently fairly
small, but it will no doubt grow - and it will make your life much easier. The purpose of the assembly is to provide
easy-to-use fakes which can be used instead of the real implementations.

(Incomplete, obviously.)
