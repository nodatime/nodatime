Release Process

This document describes how Noda Time is released. It is intended to be used as
a checklist by the person doing a release.

## When to release

When everybody's happy, there are no issues outstanding for the milestone, and
all the tests pass.

Search the issue tracker for open issues with the right label (e.g.
`label:Milestone-1.0`).

Update to the candidate revision (probably tip) and
[build and run all the tests](building.html) as normal. The build and test
steps need to pass on:

- Visual Studio 2008
- Visual Studio 2010
- Mono 2.10.5
- Mono 2.10.8

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2010
- Sandcastle
- TODO: anything else? Release keys? Logins to nuget.org?

Note that we cannot build releases on Mono at present, since they trigger a bug
in the .NET 4 64-bit CLR (see the [building and testing](building.html) section
in the developer guide).

## Update the embedded tzdb

If necessary, update the version of tzdb to the latest current version,
following the instructions in the ["Updating the time zone database"][tzdb]
section in the user guide.

[tzdb]: ../userguide/tzdb.html

## Making the release

If necessary, update the following AssemblyInfo files and NuGet package specs
to include the version number you are building:

- `src/NodaTime/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs`
- `src/NodaTime.Testing/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs`
- `src/NodaTime/NodaTime.nuspec`
- `src/NodaTime.Testing/NodaTime.Testing.nuspec`

The various versions should be set according to the following scheme. Suppose
we were building version 1.2.3-beta4, then:

- In the NuGet package specs, `<version>` should contain the version number
  ('1.2.3-beta4'). The `<dependency>` element in `NodaTime.Testing.nuspec`
  should reference the _initial release_ for the major/minor version
  (i.e. '1.2.0').
- In the AssemblyInfo files, `AssemblyVersion` should be set to just the
  major/minor version ('1.2'). `AssemblyFileVersion` should be set to the
  major, minor, and patch version ('1.2.3'), and `AssemblyInformationalVersion`
  should be set to the version number ('1.2.3-beta4'). (See [this Stack
  Overflow post][assemblyversion] for more information about how these are
  used.)

[assemblyversion]: http://stackoverflow.com/a/65062

Add the current date and TZDB version to the version history in
`tools/userguide-src/markdown/versions.txt` and regenerate all documentation.

Commit the above, then tag that commit:

    hg tag 1.0.0-beta1

## Building the release artifacts

First, create a new clone for building the release. (Doing this avoids the
need to worry about ignored files and local changes.)

Update to the correct revision, if you didn't specify it when cloning the
repository:

    hg up -r 1.0.0-beta1

Export the clean source archive:

    hg archive NodaTime-1.0.0-beta1-src.zip

Next, get ready to build the release zipfile. Create a directory called e.g.
`NodaTime-1.0.0-beta1` containing the following files and directories:

    docs/api/
    docs/developer/
    docs/userguide/
    LICENSE.txt
    NOTICE.txt
    readme.txt

Now build the release libaries, XML documentation, and NuGet packages:

    buildnuget.bat

This will create e.g. `nuget/NodaTime.1.0.0-beta1.nupkg` and
`nuget/NodaTime.Testing.1.0.0-beta1.nupkg`.

Copy the following build outputs into the _root_ of your zipfile directory:

    docs/PublicApi/NodaTime.xml
    docs/PublicApi/NodaTime.Testing.xml
    src/NodaTime/bin/Signed Release/NodaTime.dll
    src/NodaTime.Testing/bin/Signed Release/NodaTime.Testing.dll

(These are the same files as are present in the NuGet packages.)

Finally, create a zipfile from the zipfile directory (using the same name,
e.g. NodaTime-1.0.0-beta1.zip).

TODO: doing this by hand is a pain.

## Publishing the artifacts

Upload the source and binary zipfiles to the
[Google Code project](http://code.google.com/p/noda-time/downloads/list).
Use the `Type-Source` label for the source zipfile, and the `Type-Archive` and
`Featured` labels for the binary zipfile.  Remove `Featured` from the previous
binary zipfile.

Upload the two NuGet packages to nuget.org. TODO: How?

## Announcing the release

Post to the mailing list, blog, etc.

## Post-release branching

After building the first release with a given minor version number (i.e. 1.0.0,
1.1.0), we'll need to branch before any new user-visible functionality is
introduced (per the [Semantic versioning](http://semver.org) spec).

The branching model used by Noda Time is the Mercurial '[standard branching][]'
model. In brief:

- feature development is carried out on the default branch
- named branches (called '1.0.x', '1.1.x', etc) are used for release lines
- fixes are typically applied to the oldest branch and forward-ported to
  each later branch in turn (ending at 'default')

[standard branching]: http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/StandardBranching

Note the last point, which may be surprising: Mercurial has no built in support
for the 'backport' or 'cherrypick' model (where fixes are applied to the
mainline and then later applied to an older branch). Instead, the fixes are
first applied to the _oldest_ branch, and then each branch is merged completely
into the next (resolving conflicts as-needed).

If a backport is necessary (for example, if it was not obvious that a fix
applied to an older version), then it can be applied using `hg export` / `hg
import` and then forward-ported as usual.

Note also the difference between the format of names used for tags
('1.0.0-beta2', '1.0.0') and those used for branches ('1.0.x'). Mercurial will
allow both to be used as revision specifiers, so it is important that they do
not collide.
