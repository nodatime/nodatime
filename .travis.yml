# Although TzdbCompiler is portable, the tests aren't, as they
# check against Windows standard time zone IDs.
# We don't currently run net451 tests on Linux, due to
# https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/3073 (which I believe
# is the reason NUnit fails as well as xUnit).
# If we *did* run the tests, we'd need to run a Release configuration
# until Travis uses Mono 4.3.1, due to
# https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=36257
