  <head>TZDB NZD files for Noda Time</head>
  <body>
    <p>
      This directory contains NZD (Noda Zone Data) files built from
      various versions of TZDB (aka IANA time zone data). When the
      embedded version in the unstable branch is updated with a new
      version of the TZDB data, the file is uploaded into this directory
      as well, so that users don't need to update to a new version of
      Noda Time to benefit from updated data. See the
      <a href="http://nodatime.org/userguide/tzdb.html">user guide</a>
      for details on how to use these files within your project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever a file is added, the <a href="latest.txt">latest.txt</a>
      file is also updated. This will always be an ASCII file *just*
      containing the URL of the latest version. You may use this to automate
      fetching the latest version.
