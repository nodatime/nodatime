    <h1>TZDB NZD files for Noda Time</h1>
    <p>
      This directory contains NZD (Noda Zone Data) files built from
      various versions of TZDB (aka IANA time zone data). When the
      embedded version in the unstable branch is updated with a new
      version of the TZDB data, the file is uploaded into this directory
      as well, so that users don't need to update to a new version of
      Noda Time to benefit from updated data. See the
      <a href="http://nodatime.org/userguide/tzdb.html">user guide</a>
      for details on how to use these files within your project. The NZD
      files in this directory should be usable for version of Noda Time
      from 1.1 upwards. (If you need the files in 1.0 format, please contact
      the mailing list.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever a file is added, the <a href="latest.txt">latest.txt</a>
      file is also updated. This will always be an ASCII file *just*
      containing the URL of the latest version. You may use this to automate
      fetching the latest version.
    </p>
    <p>TODO: hopefully we'll come up with a nice way of listing the contents
     of the directory here too... for the moment, just look at <a href="latest.txt">latest.txt</a>
     or check for a file of the form <code>tzdb(version).nzd</code>, e.g. <a href="tzdb2013h.nzd">tzdb2013h.nzd</a>.
